            <h1 class="heading1">Description</h1>
            <p class="page1">This recipe is filled with 
                tangy barbecue sauce, sweet brown sugar, 
                mustard for a kick, green pepper, onion, 
                and maybe (definitely) the best addition 
                of all—bacon! The beans are topped with 
                strips of partially-cooked bacon, and baked 
                low and slow until the bacon gets a little 
                crispy and the beans thicken. The result is 
                baked beans that are smoky, sweet, tangy, and 
                absolutely unforgettable! You'll never make 
                them any other way.</p>

            <h1 class="heading3">Directions</h1>
            <ul class="page3">
                <li>Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325°.</li>
                <li>bacon in large, deep sauté pan until bacon has partially
                    cooked and released about 1/4 cup drippings. Remove bacon from 
                    pan and drain on paper towels. </li>
                <li>Add onion and pepper to drippings in pan and sauté until tender,
                     about 5 minutes. </li>
                <li>Add beans and remaining ingredients to pan; bring to a simmer.
                     (If pan is not large enough, add beans and heat to a simmer 
                     then transfer to a large bowl and stir in remaining
                      ingredients). </li>
                <li>Pour flavored beans into a greased 13-by-9-inch 
                    (or similar size) ovenproof pan. Top with bacon,
                     then bake until beans are bubbly and sauce is 
                     the consistency of pancake syrup, about 2 hours.
                      Let stand to thicken slightly and serve.</li>
